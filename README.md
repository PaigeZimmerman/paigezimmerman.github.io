### Introduction

Hello! My name is Paige and I am an undergraduate student at Lehigh University (class of 2024). I am pursuing a Marketing major, an Art Studio minor, and the Business Analytics Certificate. I am also a regionally and nationally ranked equestrian in the sport of dressage. I have been working with horses since I was 2, and I don't intend on stopping anytime soon! Addiitonally I am a commissioned award-winning artist; I create pet and animal portraits. My primary medium is colored pencil, though I dabble in other mediums too, such as acrylic paint. I am excited to have the opportunity to learn on GitHub and widen my knowledge of the world of data storytelling.
